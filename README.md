# ☁️ 100 Days of Cloud Security by Zeteo

Welcome to my personal journey through **100 Days of Cloud Security** — a hands-on series of real-world misconfiguration labs, IAM experiments, detection drills, and cloud hardening practices.

🔐 Each day focuses on learning a cloud security concept by doing:
- Simulating misconfigurations (e.g. open S3 buckets, weak IAM policies)
- Practicing detection & remediation
- Applying least privilege, logging, and secure design principles

🎯 Goal: To build and document practical, portfolio-ready skills in AWS security, detection engineering, and cloud misconfig analysis.
