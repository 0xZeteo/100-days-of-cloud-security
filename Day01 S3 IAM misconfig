# 🌩️ Day 1 of 100 Days of Cloud Security – Public S3 Bucket Exposure

Welcome to my first log in the **100 Days of Cloud Security Challenge**. I'm documenting my learning journey one day at a time — no shortcuts, just honest progress.

---

## ✅ What I Did

### 1. Created a Public S3 Bucket

I created a new S3 bucket called:

```

zeteosec-demo-public-bucket

```

Then uploaded a sample file named:

```

sensitive.txt

```

This file acted as a fake confidential document in this test case.

---

### 2. Configured the Bucket to Be Public (Intentionally)

At first, I had issues getting a public object URL. I kept seeing:

```

Access Denied

````

After some debugging, I found that:

- The bucket's **Block Public Access** setting was enabled.
- The object itself wasn't set to be public.

---

### 3. Resolved Access Denied Errors

Here’s what I did to fix it:

- **Unblocked public access** for the bucket via the permissions tab.
- **Set a bucket policy** to explicitly allow public access.
- Used this policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowPublicRead",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::zeteosec-demo-public-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
````

After saving, the object URL worked!

---

### 4. Final Result

I was able to access the file using:

```
https://zeteosec-demo-public-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/sensitive.txt
```

Anyone with this link could view/download the file — no login required.

## 🔒 Why This Matters

Exposing an S3 bucket publicly is a **real-world risk**. Many data breaches have happened this way — credentials, PII, or config files were exposed unintentionally.

Understanding this from the attacker’s POV helps build better defenses.

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

* Public buckets = high risk if not intended
* Always check `Block Public Access` settings
* Bucket policies override default protection
* Be mindful of what you upload and share

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

* AWS Console (S3)
* IAM Policy Editor
* My browser 😉

## 🎥 Coming Up

I’ll be uploading a short video walkthrough of this on my channel [**ZeteoSec**](https://youtube.com/@ZeteoSec). Stay tuned!
